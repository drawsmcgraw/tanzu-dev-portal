        &lt;p&gt;If you are securing a REST API with JWTs, chances are you either 1. use an authorization server or 2. have read countless variations on how a REST API can mint its own JWTs. Is this a good idea? If so, how should you go about doing it? In this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll start with an unsecured REST API and review the trade-offs of having it use self-signed JWTs. By the end, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a better idea whether this is an option for you.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Buildpacks are a pluggable, modular, language-agnostic tool that takes application source code and gives you an OCI (Open Container Initiative) image that you can run using Docker, Kubernetes, or your OCI Runtime of choice. Tired of writing and maintaining Dockerfiles and vetting base images? Unsure how that monitoring or security agent needs to be installed? Feeling pressure from your Security team about your images? Just want to get back to coding? Buildpacks have you covered. You write code and buildpacks take care of the rest. Don&amp;rsquo;t believe it? Come check out this session, which will take you from doing things the hard way to doing them the buildpacks way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tanzu Tuesdays: The road to Native Images – what can trip me up? With Dan Dobrin</title>

        &lt;p&gt;Increased cloud adoption by deploying modern apps in K8s opens up entire new sets of use-cases for enterprises on a constant basis. Hence the need to create lightweight and efficient containers that start almost instantly and consume less memory and CPU by orders of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Native Images are the next chapter of Spring’s innovation journey in the K8s world. Can Spring Native with GraalVM make the migration to native images seamless? Is there anything that could potentially trip us up? What do we need to know when migrating apps to native? Can we learn to write better Java code in the process?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s answer these questions by looking into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does Just-in-time vs Ahead-of-time compilation compare?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding Runtime vs Build-Time Class Initialization for Spring Native Images&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ahead-of-time compilation limitations - what do I need to know and how is Spring Native helping me to mitigate them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s working differently for some of the Java’s features in Native Images?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can we learn to write better Java code in the process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As developers we learn by example … let&amp;rsquo;s use some practical ones&amp;hellip; then explore the topic further at our leisure with a comprehensive set as reference&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;As application developers we spend a lot of time thinking of ways to improve the efficiency of our web application. We could completely rewrite it, leverage more concurrency and even add reactive features. But how do we know if it is more efficient if we don&amp;rsquo;t measure and track relevant metrics? Once the application is pushed to production, we might also need to monitor the status of external services that the application relies on. For easy consumption of such metrics, being able to visualize them on a dashboard may make understanding the application behavior easier. In this talk, we will cover how metrics collected by a Spring Boot application can be sent to Tanzu Observability (Wavefront) using the Wavefront Spring Boot starter. Using a WebFlux demo application, we will go over out-of-the-box metrics, add custom metrics and look at how a slow remote service can be detected. We will also look at sending trace data to Wavefront.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Everyone experienced problems with the software that they run. We all want to know how to fix things quickly and reliably, in a confidence-inspiring manner. Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest: &amp;ldquo;stop and start it&amp;rdquo; fixes are not an option for VMware customers which use our products in mission critical applications: emergency systems, factories, autonomous vehicles, etc.  RabbitMQ is this type of a system. Those responsible for it need to know when problems hit, preferably in advance, and they need a clear path to resolution. While RabbitMQ exposes a wealth of metrics, logs, and events, and has decent dashboards that help visualise these, we know that users only look at dashboards when there is a problem. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be great if RabbitMQ notified you when there is a problem in the making? How about a run book on how to fix that specific problem? Imagine if some problems could even be fixed automatically. That is the direction that we are going towards. Let us show you what we have so far.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;With the quantity and types of data that must be processed in real time by enterprises today, we may be asking ourselves, &amp;ldquo;How do we create solutions to process this data and how do we orchestrate these solutions?&amp;rdquo; This discussion shows how Spring Cloud Data Flow (SCDF) can continuously deploy, scale, monitor, and manage your stream and batch workloads by using the capabilities
on Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session walks you through the tooling capabilities of SCDF. In addition to the core orchestration features, you will also see a demo of creating a real-time streaming pipeline on Kubernetes, using recipes such as functional composition of the applications, and managing workloads. You will also see a demo on scheduling and continuously deploying batch workloads on Kubernetes, creating a single-step batch job with no coding, and distributing batch job processing across multiple machines.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Jonatan is a new addition to the Spring Team, he’s going to talk about his interviewing experience, his daily work in the Spring Team and this is also a good opportunity to ask questions from him.  You can often hear that logging, metrics, and distributed tracing are the &amp;ldquo;three pillars of Observability&amp;rdquo; but having access to them does not necessarily mean more observable systems. We will talk about what Observability is, what problems the three pillars solve, what problems they generate and what Spring has to offer to implement the three pillars and what else you can find in Spring to look under the hood of your running system.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;With the adoption of API-enabled microservices increasing at a rapid rate, centrally-managed enterprise services are having a hard time keeping up. More and more, development teams are performing quick API releases, straining central API management approaches, and leading to days and weeks of delay.  That’s why enterprises must harness the agility that distributed source control and API management can provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this webinar, we’ll cover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilizing GitOps for releases through continuously integrated and delivered software processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to align APIs with our GitOps delivery model and route definitions with their associated source code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes applies this GitOps for APIs model to enable agility across your development teams.
Get the reliable, consistent software delivery controls needed in a high-performance operations environment.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Imagine that you&amp;rsquo;re receiving a support ticket that your application is not working fine. You read the attached stack trace and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to solve the mystery - what did the user do that lead to throwing of this exception? Is it possible to find all the logs from all the applications that correspond to this user&amp;rsquo;s business operation?  What if the user is complaining that the system is slow? How can you decide which concrete operation is the culprit? Is there any way to visualize the latency?  Let&amp;rsquo;s answer these questions by taking a deep dive into application observability using distributed tracing, metrics, and correlated logs via Spring Cloud Sleuth, Tanzu Observability, OpenZipkin, OpenTelemetry, and more!  The presentation will consist of some theory but there&amp;rsquo;ll also be live coding and demos.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Join our special guests, the Tanzu Vanguards, as they discuss Containers and Monitoring. Current applications often consist of many different containerized services. This is great for portability and scaling, but how do you know when to scale up and down and how do your business transactions behave in this microservice mesh? And from a platform perspective, how do you ensure your platform can cope with the app&amp;rsquo;s demands?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, you will learn which tools are currently available (example: Prometheus, Tanzu Observability by Wavefront, etc.) and which tool is suitable for which portion of the story. Learn what are the ups and downs of each tool and see from a user&amp;rsquo;s perspective which features are mandatory and which are just nice to have. Finally, we also plan to take on the most difficult, challenging question currently facing the DevOps world: Where does the monitoring responsibility of a DevOps team end and what portions of the monitoring challenge are in the Platform team&amp;rsquo;s realm? Please join us on 4/13 to find out!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In this episode, we’ll take a Kotlin Spring Boot application, secure it and compile it to a native executable. We will start with an insecure application and secure it from the ground up using the Spring Security Kotlin DSL. Then, using Spring Native, we will compile the application to a native executable, creating a lightweight container with reduced memory consumption and near instant startup time.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Microservice architectures simplify the individual components that comprise our applications, but they introduce new complexity in managing a high number of distributed APIs. With so many moving parts, how can you provide a simplified experience for consumers and ensure that your system is resilient and secure? Centralized gateways have been a long-standing solution for managing APIs, but microservices demand a new generation of lightweight micro-gateway applications. Spring Cloud Gateway is one such solution. It provides a simple yet flexible API to add the routing, resilience, and control you need to protect the edge layer of your applications. Built on Spring WebFlux, it also ensures an inherently non-blocking mechanism for efficiently routing and manipulating requests.  In this talk, we&amp;rsquo;ll review the motivation for Spring Cloud Gateway and demonstrate a variety of features, such as weighted routing, circuit breakers, rate limiters, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Historically, application configuration has been managed internal to an application deployment, in environment variables, or in files placed in the filesystem of the running application. As applications evolved into microservices, however, that approach become inadequate. Centralized configuration, including application-specific and shared configuration, versioning and rollback capabilities, and auditing became necessary. As more applications and microservices are becoming containerized and deployed in Kubernetes, configuration continues to be challenging. While Kubernetes offers configuration via ConfigMaps and Secrets, there&amp;rsquo;s no clear way to manage the properties going into those resources.  In this Tanzu Tuesday session, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore the Tanzu Configuration Service, a means of managing configuration in a Kubernetes-native way using ConfigMaps, but that also offers the benefits afforded in a centralized configuration option.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Events have become a key element of modern application design especially when it comes to distributed applications. But also in monolithic applications they can be used to improve modularity as Spring’s ApplicationEvent abstraction and the associated infrastructure components make it easy to design, publish and consume events.  The talks starts by giving an overview about the building blocks of Spring’s core event infrastructure. It continues with an example of how to decouple Spring components using events, discusses different ways of implementing a variety of interaction scenarios and how Spring Data allows to take a more domain-driven approach to event publication. We end up by discussing advanced event handling scenarios and failure handling.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;This session will be hands-on and doing live-coding - in order to show you how to use Spring Tools 4 to be super productive when working on Spring Boot applications. We’ll demonstrate all the additional help to create, understand, and navigate your Spring code, including super fast navigation across Spring definitions, deep understanding of your Spring code, and more. We’ll dive into the details of how information from live-running Spring Boot apps will appear directly in your source code to provide unique insights into your running application. You’ll see why Spring beans are(n’t) being created and where they are being injected (including navigation), available URL routes from running apps, and more. The live-coding will be done using a mixture of clients, ranging from Spring Tools 4 for Eclipse to Visual Studio Code, including support for up to Java 15, and useful features of the tooling to make every attendee more productive implementing applications on top of Spring Boot.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Spring Native is a new effort from the Spring team that allows to compile Spring applications to native executables, using GraalVM, in order to create lightweight containers that start almost instantly and consume 4x less memory than the same application running on a regular JVM. Sébastien will share the latest status of this effort, with more details on the upcoming beta of Spring Native for GraalVM, the ongoing challenges and how the Spring team plan to address them.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If you’re using one of the great observability tools out there, you probably already mark your data with important events that may affect it- deployments, configuration changes, etc. But what about changes Kubernetes makes on its own like autoscaling events? We’ll talk about Knative Eventing and how we can use it to automatically mark these events in your data, and some other ways you can use it to improve your Observability.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Modern web-scale applications place exacting demands on data for speed and latency. These demands are difficult to satisfy with heritage SQL data systems, which were never designed for modern applications or deployment mechanisms like containers.  On top of that, the need for SQL-like consistency and transaction integrity remains. Is it possible for a database to reconcile all of these competing requirements? In this session we will go through different use cases where Tanzu GemFire can provide value to the customer and outcomes it drives. We will also go through the high-level overview of the product.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Nearly every app needs a database. Two of the most popular databases in the world are open source, and free to use. After 22 years in the industry, VMware knows everything about running databases in mission-critical environments and in the cloud. Now, we blend that expertise with our leadership in Kubernetes to bring you Tanzu SQL. We make it easy for Operators to set up a database service which provides cost-efficient and flexible deployments on-demand, automates time-consuming administration tasks, and satisfies enterprise requirements — on any cloud, anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Spring Security was born in the days of server-generated HTML, when JavaScript was that annoying little brother you avoided but couldn’t keep from following you around. Now, JavaScript is all grown-up with a mortgage, a family, and a debugger. Is Spring Security still relevant in these modern times where many backends are little more than a REST API? In this talk, you’ll see why the answer is “yes”. We’ll start with an unsecured JavaScript frontend and Spring Boot backend. Step-by-step, we’ll make decisions about CORS, CSRF, and OAuth, each simplified by Spring Security. Also, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a sneak peek at the experimental Spring Authorization Server!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In this episode, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss the latest changes in Spring Boot 2.3 and 2.4 that make your life easier when deploying your apps to Kubernetes.
In fact, those features are generally useful if you&amp;rsquo;re pushing your apps to any type of platform: from packaging your app as a container image to publishing liveness/readiness probes, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how you can leverage those features in a sample Spring Boot application.
Feel free to join and ask any Spring Boot-related question; if time allows it, we can even chat about the upcoming Spring Framework 5.3 features such as startup time profiling!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s day 2. The corporate k8s cluster is humming. Everything works perfectly in a local environment, but how do you connect the wires? Your first few steps in Kubernetes may feel like walking through uncharted territory. Yet, several tools can make you just as productive as you were in your comfortable local setup. With only a few changes in your configuration, you can automatically rebuild clusters when a file changes and even debug software running in containers. Add this to some visualization tools and some templating software, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be back on track very quickly. In this talk, you’ll learn how to use some open source tooling available around the Kubernetes ecosystem to become more productive and optimize for developer joy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Join Us&lt;/strong&gt; in a cloud-native app building experience that Spring Boot provides out of the box! Why guess at the state of microservices in a Kubernetes-centric scenario when Spring can help us get that status out? We will code with Kotlin on the JVM and use Spring’s declarative access to the liveness/readiness state and its health monitoring subsystem. Next, we’ll see a recent Spring Boot feature that lets us declare container build and execution parameters using a build tool like Maven or Gradle. Finally, we step into configuration state transfer and service discovery so that application runtime behavior gets defined with Kubernetes idioms like ConfigMaps and Secret. This demo will look at how to tie these characteristics of Spring and Kubernetes together to produce a resilient cloud-native application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you first started experimenting with Kubernetes, you may have started locally or on a set of servers. With simple applications, you may only have used a container registry and Kubernetes itself. When looking to move your clusters to a production setting, there are many more considerations, such as: How will I manage my clusters? How do I handle monitoring and logging? How do I safely back up my cluster resources? How do I ensure that my container images are safe and secure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at some production-ready solutions, such as VMware Tanzu Mission Control, VMware Tanzu Observability by Wavefront, Octant, Velero, and Harbor.&lt;/p&gt;

Behind the scenes you might assume code watching every line of code, ready to respond to pre-programmed commands. But what happens when the channel has 1k views? 10k? 100k? All chatting and interacting, exchanging thousands of messages a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spring Boot and Project Reactor to the rescue! This week on Tanzu Tuesday, we’ll build our very own chat bot. Started as a project inspired by episodes featuring &lt;a href=&#34;/tv/tanzu-tuesdays/0001/&#34;&gt;Josh Long&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;/tv/tanzu-tuesdays/0009/&#34;&gt;Spencer Gibb&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;rsquo;ll see how reactive programming helps tackle the massive volume of messages, how to package and deploy it to Kubernetes, &lt;a href=&#34;/guides/kubernetes/observability-prometheus-grafana-p1/&#34;&gt;gather metrics with Prometheus and visualize them in Grafana&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demo code is available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/BrianMMcClain/reactive-bot-framework&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Dockerfiles are the de facto tool many developers reach for when transforming source code into images. However, organizations frequently encounter day-2 problems that present serious obstacles to running Dockerfile-built images in production. Cloud Foundry and Heroku fans will be familiar with the previous generation of buildpacks, which work in concert with the platform to solve many of these problems including application and OS-level dependency updates. However, tight-coupling to the platform comes with drawbacks. The Cloud Native Buildpacks project thinks we can do better.
Cloud Native Buildpacks bring the best operational features of the Cloud Foundry platform to the modern container ecosystem all while providing a seamless developer experience. In this session Emily demonstrate how developers can use the pack CLI and Paketo buildpacks to build and upgrade images. Then we will dig into what is happening behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The shift to cloud computing involves a veritable plethora of new technologies and approaches. From 12 factors to domain driven design, change is afoot. Your organization is knee deep in functions and platforms and containers and while the technology is important, we can’t afford to overlook the importance of culture. What changes when we go to the cloud? How do we get there? How does Conway&amp;rsquo;s law affect the success of our efforts? How can we help people navigate the latest evolution in computing? This talk will explore how cloud native computing impacts more than just our architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Perhaps you have heard of 12-factor apps, cloud-native, or 15-factor apps. Maybe you have wondered if cloud-native was right for you. In this session we will explore how to deliver apps using this methodology on Kubernetes. We will start by explaining the 15-factors. We will also review the cloud native features that are built into Kubernetes. Then we will create a new application, for Kubernetes, and demonstrate how to make it &amp;ldquo;15 factor cloud native on Kubernetes&amp;rdquo;!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In this session we are going to show you how to get your Spring apps up and running on Kubernetes.  This session will take you from everyone’s favorite place on the internet, start.spring.io all the way to automated deployments directly to Kubernetes.  We will cover tools, as well as best practices, that will make getting your Spring app from your dev machine to your Kubernetes (production) even faster and easier.  In addition we will spend some time showing you how to use Spring Cloud Kubernetes to build cloud native Spring apps that run on Kubernetes.  By the end of this session you will have all the knowledge you need to target Kubernetes as your production environment.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Custom controllers and custom resource definitions are all the rage in Kubernetes today! In conjunction, they allow users to extend the Kubernetes API and introduce additional features.
In this session, we’ll explore both custom resource definitions and custom controllers by trying out popular projects that allow us to craft a new controller from scratch!&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;How can we better collaborate on creating useful APIs? How to reduce the testing time of your application? How can the team build API backwards compatibility verification into their deployment process?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Olga will discuss how to leverage the Consumer-Driven Contracts approach to solve these and other issues and present one of CDC implementations - Spring Cloud Contract. Olga will discuss practical use-cases and look at code examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olga will also point out some of the possible issues and ways of handling them, as well as some good practices I have learned while working both as a CDC tools end-user and their developer.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at configuring your Kubernetes workloads. How do we go from YAML to something that is consumable by mere mortals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From there, is it possible to go back to YAML?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, Bryan will walk through ways to manage your YAML and present what may be an easier method for configuration and keeping your clusters up to date.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;More often than not Spring moves forwards by reacting to demand, but sometimes it also tries to move first into a new area, anticipating demand in the community. In both cases, though, there are usually experimental stages, sometimes for quite long periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has always been the case, but the Spring team has recently created a special place for those experiments to happen, and that gives us a chance to spy on what is going on. This talk will be taking a look at some of the current experiments, as well as reviewing some older ones, successful and unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
