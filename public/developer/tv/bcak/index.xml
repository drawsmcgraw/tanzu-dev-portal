        &lt;p&gt;Please join Nate Schutta and Baruch Sadogursky, (a.k.a JBaruch), the Head of DevOps Advocacy and a Developer Advocate at JFrog. His passion is speaking about technology. Well, speaking in general, but doing it about technology makes him look smart, and 19 years of hi-tech experience sure helps. When he’s not on stage (or on a plane to get there), he learns about technology, people and how they work, or more precisely, don’t work together.  He is a co-author of the Liquid Software book, a CNCF ambassador and a passionate conference speaker on DevOps, DevSecOps, digital transformation, containers and cloud-native, artifact management, and other topics, and is a regular at the industry’s most prestigious events including KubeCon, DockerCon, Devoxx, DevOps Days, OSCON, Qcon, JavaOne and many others. You can see some of his talks at jfrog.com/shownotes&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Please join Nate Schutta and Jonathan Johnson, an independent software architect with a concentration on helping others unpack the riches in the cloud native and Kubernetes ecosystems. For 30 years Jonathan has been designing useful software to move businesses forward. His career began creating laboratory instrument software and throughout the years, his focus has been moving with industry advances benefitting from Moore’s Law. He was enticed by the advent of object-oriented design and applied it to financial software. As banking moved to the internet, enterprise applications took off and Java exploded onto the scene. Since then, he has inhabited that ecosystem. After a few years, he returned to laboratory software and leveraged Java-based state machines and enterprise services to manage the terabytes of data flowing out of DNA sequencing instruments. As a hands-on architect, he applied the advantages of microservices, containers, and Kubernetes with a laboratory management platform.&lt;/p&gt;

She has facilitated retrospectives and other meetings for the past 15 years during which time she has made all the mistakes possible in that field.&lt;/p&gt;
