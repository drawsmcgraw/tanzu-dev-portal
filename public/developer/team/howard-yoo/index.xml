        &lt;p&gt;As more and more sources of metrics become available for monitoring, the problem
shifts from whether or not right metrics are available to whether we can possibly
manage all of this data. Today&amp;rsquo;s systems consist of many servers, virtual
machines, containers, and microservices, and it is becoming challenging to keep
up with the increasing number of charts and dashboards that accompany these
sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One approach to managing this situation is to delegate some of the monitoring work
to machines. Anomoly detection is an emerging solution that can be used to detect
abnormal behavior without requiring humans to define and maintain the set of conditions
that are deemed abnormal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;detecting-anomolies-with-standard-deviation&#34;&gt;Detecting Anomolies with Standard Deviation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most popular way to detect abnormal patterns in a set of data is to
calculate how much the current value of a metric deviates from prior values. For
example, suppose we query for the idle CPU for a particular service:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ts(cpu.usage.idle, not cpu=cpu-total)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This query produces the following graph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/outcomes/app-observability/anomoly-cpu-metric.png&#34; alt=&#34;CPU Idle Metric&#34;  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we form a query to calculate how much the current value of the metric differs from the
standard deviation over some time window (1 day in this example):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;data = ts(cpu.usage.idle, not cpu=cpu-total)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;deviation = (${data} - mavg(1d, ${data})) / sqrt(mvar(1d, ${data}))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/outcomes/app-observability/anomoly-stdev.png&#34; alt=&#34;Metric with Standard Deviation&#34;  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this image, the original metric is faded out, and the highlighted metric
shows how much the current value differs from standard. During normal operation,
This value mostly hovers around 0, as there is a very small amount of deviation.
Note that this holds true even though the underlying metric moves from
approximately 98.2 to 99.6 - we only see a major change in the deviation during
the transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach leaves plenty of room for improvement. The query is long and
difficult to understand. Additionally, the user must explicitly set the
condition under which an alert will be fired. For example, we can see that two
alerts are generated if we alert when the absolute value of the deviation is
greater than 1.5, indicated by the red vertical slices in the following diagram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/outcomes/app-observability/anomoly-stdev-alerts.png&#34; alt=&#34;Alerting with Standard Deviation&#34;  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, setting the alert threshold correctly takes some adjustment.
With a value of 1.5, the alert was not sensitive enough to detect the anomolies
at the beginning and end of the graph depicted here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;detecting-anomolies-with-the-anomalous-function&#34;&gt;Detecting Anomolies with the Anomalous Function&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wavefront Query Language (WQL) includes an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.wavefront.com/ts_anomalous.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;nofollow&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;anomalous&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function that can be
used to simplify this process. The syntax of the function is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;anomalous(testWindow, confidence, expression)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;testWindow&lt;/code&gt; is the length of the moving time window to check for anomalous points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;confidence&lt;/code&gt; is a number from 0.0 to 1.0 that expresses the confidence factor
for determining the range of expected values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this knowledge, we can improve upon our previous query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;interpolate(anomalous(1h, 0.99, ts(cpu.usage.idle, not cpu=cpu-total)))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This query returns the percentage of anomalous points in the last one hour with
a confidence of 99% By default, it predicts the expected values of the metric
using the actual values over the past day. This behavior can be customized with
additional optional parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of this query show a spike that lines up with each anomoly in the
underlying data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/images/outcomes/app-observability/anomoly-anomalous.png&#34; alt=&#34;Anomalous Function Example&#34;  /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anomaly detection can be a convenient way to apply alerting logic to a large
number of metrics without investing large amounts of time understanding each
individual metric and defining what normal operation looks like. This is
especially useful in cases where:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;large amounts of trial and error are required to determine when an alert
should be raised&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you need to apply alerts to a system where there are a many metrics and you
have limited knowledge about how they should behave&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the definition of &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; changes over time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with any technology, this solution shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used in all cases, as the
results will vary with the query parameters and patterns in the data. If you are
intimately familiar with the underlying data and the conditions which should
trigger an alert, you will likely find better results building your own query.
Anomoly detection is a promising technology that deserves a place in your
observability toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;
